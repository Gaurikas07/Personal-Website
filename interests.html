    <br>
    <h2 align="center">I am a passionate dancer. I am dancing since my childhood</h2>
    <center>
    <p>
    From the tender age when rhythm first whispered to my soul, I've been entranced by the elegance of classical <br> dance. With every step, I weave stories, embodying the grace of tradition and the fervour of my own <br>spirit. From childhood, I've embraced this art form, nurturing it with every sway and pirouette until it <br>became an inseparable part of who I am.<br>
    <br>


    Through the years, my dedication has been unwavering. I've graced countless stages, each performance a <br>testament to my passion and dedication. Whether it's the glimmering lights of a grand function or the <br>intimate setting of a college Diwali fest, my presence commands attention, my movements painting the air<br>with tales of love, loss, and triumph.
